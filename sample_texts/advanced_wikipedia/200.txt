Huso nudiventris are usually anadromous—meaning they live in saltwater and travel to freshwaters to deposit eggs—but some can spend their entire life cycle in freshwater.[10] Because they travel from saltwater to freshwater to spawn, they often live nearby estuaries.[10] Migration to freshwaters for deposition of eggs occurs during spring between the months of March and May, and fall between October and November.[10][7] On average, female bastard sturgeon produce between 200,000 and 300,000 eggs over the course of their lifetime.[9] The young Huso nudiventris can live in freshwater for years following birth prior to traveling to the sea, though many migrate to the sea soon after birth.[6] The average time between birth of subsequent Huso nudiventris is around 15 years; variation in generation time of this species is somewhat dependent on human fishing patterns and whether the species is thriving in its environment. Formerly abundant in the Black, Aral and Caspian seas, its range is now primarily limited to the Ural River (in Russia and Kazakhstan), with possible relict populations in the Rioni River in Georgia and the Safid Rud in Iran. One of the most established populations is one in Lake Balkhash in Kazakhstan, well outside its natural range, where
